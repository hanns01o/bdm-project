# Core Cycle Collective Fitness Studio SQL Model

## Project Overview
A database solution for a fictional fitness studio, developed as a course project for Business Data Management at Singapore Management University (SMU). As part of a data analyst team, I designed and implemented a scalable SQL model to support business intelligence and inform data-driven decisions.

## Project Objectives
* Designed Enhanced Entity-Relationship (EER) model to optimize data structure and relationships.
* Translated EER model into logical SQL design for efficient data storage and retrieval.
* Generated synthetic data using AI for realistic scenario testing
* Developed actionable SQL queries for:
› Schedule optimization
› Resource allocation
› Payment tracking and revenue analysis
› Employee management and HR reporting

## Technical Skills Used
* SQL: database creation, data modelling, query creation
